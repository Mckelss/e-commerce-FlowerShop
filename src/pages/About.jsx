            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to KugiHands, your trusted flower shop in the heart of Cagayan de Oro City. Rooted in the belief that every flower tells a story, we specialize in creating handcrafted and fresh floral arrangements that transform simple moments into cherished memories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our name, KugiHands, is inspired by the dedicated, hardworking hands behind every bouquet we create. Each petal we touch and each stem we place reflects our passion for detail, beauty, and emotional connection.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
              KugiHands blossomed three years ago when our founder realized how deeply people connect through flowers. We saw how a single bloom could speak volumes—comforting the sorrowful, celebrating love, and bringing light to someone’s day. What started as a small dream has since grown into a meaningful mission: to help people express emotions through the timeless language of flowers.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
              At KugiHands, we are committed to creating lasting memories through the freshness and beauty of our flower arrangements. Whether it’s a grand celebration, a heartfelt apology, or a simple “just because,” our blooms are thoughtfully designed to speak from the heart.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <p>
              We envision a world where love, joy, and kindness are shared one flower at a time. Through the vibrance of our floral designs, we aim to spread beauty, connection, and heartfelt emotions throughout our community and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for letting us be part of your special moments. Us KugiHands, are here to help you express what words sometimes cannot.</p>
